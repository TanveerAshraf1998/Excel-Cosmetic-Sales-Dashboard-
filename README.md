# Excel-Cosmetic-Sales-Dashboard-
. I create sales dashboards in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables and charts. Recently, I developed a dashboard for a Cosmetic Sales Report. It included charts like bar graphs and pie charts to show sales data for different products and time periods. This dashboard helped stakeholders easily see sales trends and make informed decisions.
